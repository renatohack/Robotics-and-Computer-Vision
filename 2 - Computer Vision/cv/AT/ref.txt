To train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for hand gesture recognition with the given datasets, you can follow these steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Normalize the images: Scale the pixel values to a range of 0 to 1.
Resize the images: Ensure that all images have the same dimensions, typically square images work well for CNNs.
Separate the datasets: Keep the CGI images and real images in separate directories.
Split the datasets: Divide each dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. A common split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
Model Architecture:

Start with a basic CNN architecture, such as a combination of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Use techniques like dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting.
Experiment with different architectures to find the best one for your specific problem. Consider using pre-trained models like VGG, ResNet, or Inception, which might provide a good starting point.
Training:

Initialize the model with random weights.
Define a loss function, such as categorical cross-entropy, suitable for multi-class classification.
Choose an optimizer, such as Adam or RMSprop, to update the model weights during training.
Train the model on the CGI dataset and fine-tune it on the real image dataset. You can either freeze the initial layers' weights during fine-tuning or use a smaller learning rate for those layers.
Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, to find the optimal configuration.
Monitor the training process using metrics like accuracy and loss on the validation set. Consider using early stopping if the model's performance plateaus.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model on the testing set to measure its performance on unseen data.
Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness.
Visualize the confusion matrix to understand the distribution of misclassifications.
Fine-tuning and Optimization:

Analyze the model's performance and identify areas of improvement.
Experiment with data augmentation techniques like rotation, translation, and scaling to increase the dataset's diversity.
Consider collecting more real images if the performance on the real image dataset is significantly lower than on the CGI dataset.
Fine-tune the model further based on the observed shortcomings and repeat the training process.
By following these steps, you can train a CNN to recognize hand gestures for rock, paper, and scissors using the provided datasets. Remember to iterate and experiment with different approaches to improve the model's performance.
